I used Colmar's logos and the photographs supplied as inspiration for the design, colour and 
typography choices throughout the site. ColmarAcademy is a website that offer people with a burning desire to learn
different choices to better themself.The desire is like the fire. The more you achieve the more the fire gets bigger.
That's why the main colour of the site is red i relate it with the fire. I used different shades of red. The first display of 
the page without hovering the mouse is coloured with shades of red that are softer for the eye. When you hover the red get
stronger to attract attention to important information on the website. And I have also added the animation that when you hover 
the red expands. So in analogy, if customers choose to start the learning process with colmar they will not get disappointed
because they will learn and the fire is going to stay alive and wanting to become even bigger. 
This is the reason behind the colours and some of the animations used. 


Through out the page I have used round borders for the images and the main heading of the sites because by doing this the 
information and the images engaged naturally with the site. I used also the animation that interchanged the rounded borders.
This is also used to attract attention. Because at the end of the day the site needs not only to be visually appealing but
also needs to make an impact to the visitors so they can take action. 

The font choices are also made with the intent to attract and impact the visitor who are the potential customers and the ones
who are going to define the success of the colmaracademy. 


I have made three font choices:
Cinzel Decorative,Cinzel-which are easy to read and visually attractive
Pacifico-which is a handwritten font that I chose in order to make the message more humanly

I hope you like my design choices!
I know there is always place for improvement.
